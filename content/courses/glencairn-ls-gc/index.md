> Release contains just the basic ground work and course layout. It's playable, but should only be used for those assisting me in designing the course.

It's been said that Glencairn is the closest you'll come to Scotland without crossing the Atlantic.

From the moment you pass the stone gates and wind your way between rock fences to the majestic multi-turreted clubhouse, you will feel like you just arrived at a Scottish links.

Designed by Thomas McBroom, Glencairn's 27 links-style holes are punctuated by steep pot bunkers and framed by fescue that waves menacingly in the ever-present wind that buffets the Halton Hills just west of Toronto. Burns (narrow meandering streams) cut through the heaving landscape of the Niagara Escarpment. You'll have to be creative on the tight lies that surround the mammoth undulating greens.

Afterwards, luxuriate in the castle-like clubhouse modeled after Scotland's Muirfield, featuring brilliant photographs from three decades of Open Championship golf taken by award-winning photographer Doug Ball.

Grab an ale in a cozy corner of the magnificently appointed Friar Pub or end your work week with a Friday night on the patio listening to one of the live bands that offer some sounds of the summer to savour with your delectable meal. The magnificent clubhouse is also an idyllic spot for hosting weddings, banquets or meetings.

Make the short jaunt to Glencairn, transport yourself to Scotland, and save the plane fare.
