As soon as you arrive at the first tee at Taboo, you understand what makes this golf course a Top 100 Course in Canada. The rugged and vibrant Canadian Shield landscape is a big part of what makes golf here truly special, including graceful white pines, mature red oaks and bold and pink granite outcroppings.

### Renovations

[Renovated in 2019](https://www.taboomuskoka.com/taboo-course-renovations/) there are a number of changes that are not available with the current elevation data.  I've taken some liberties by merging some of the notable changes while keeping older layouts that would have been too difficult to change manually.
