> Royal Ashburn is my dads favorite course.  It's where we've spent fathers day for most of the last decade.  Now that he's older and sicker and unable to play a full round, I'm hoping to get him into the simulator for a couple more games.

In the spring of 1962, The Royal Ashburn Golf Club opened as an 18-hole facility, and has since developed into a world-class facility, ranked among the Top 50 public golf courses in Canada. Originally opening under the name Whitby Golf Club, the name was quickly changed to Thunderbird Golf Club, as it was known for many years.

In the spring of 2000, we changed the name one final time to The Royal Ashburn Golf Club, which is much more suitable to the first-class facility we are today.

To further reflect our history and contributions to the game of golf, The Royal Ashburn Golf Club was granted Armorial Bearings (coat of Arms) on September 15, 2006, granted to us by the authority vested in the Governor General to exercise the prerogative of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada.
