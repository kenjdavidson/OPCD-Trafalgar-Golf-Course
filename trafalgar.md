# Trafalgar Golf & Country Club

> I stopped working on this since someone else @judojeff was also working on the same course.  I got it as far as the Unity stage and playing around with some basic vegetation.

### V1 

At this point the course is playable with no/limited vegetation.  I may come back to Trafalgar to practice with vegetation and sat shading, but at this point @judojeff will be finishing the course.
